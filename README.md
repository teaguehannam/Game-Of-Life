### Description

#### The Game of Life, also known as Life, is a cellular automation created by mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. The game takes place on a two-diminsional grid, and each box or cell can either be live or dead. The state of the cell's neighbors decides wether the current cell will be live or dead, on the next step in time. The game can hae chaotic, unpredictable outcomes, self-replicating structures, all within a very simple set of rules.

#### Recreated by: Teague Hannam

### Description

###### The Game of Life, also known as Life, is a cellular automation created by mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. The game takes place on a two-diminsional grid, and each box or cell can either be live or dead. The state of the cell's neighbors decides whether the current cell will be live or dead, on the next step in time. The game can have chaotic unpredictable outcomes, and self-replicating structures, all within a very simple set of rules.

### Rules

##### Neightbors can be to the left/right, up/down, or diagonal.

* Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies.
* Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on.
* Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies.
* Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell.

### Features I'd add

* Ability to make grid bigger/smaller
* Speed up render time (Can't update above 4.5 frames per second)
* Mobile compatability
